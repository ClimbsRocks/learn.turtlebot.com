To state the obvious, bringing robots to the mainstream will require a massive number of people passionately developing robots. To date, robotic development has had a fairly high technical barrier to entry. Let’s tear down the barriers and allow any developer who wants to program a robot to start learning how now with:

1. Minimal cost - many developers will be purchasing their own equipment
2. Open source software - to support collaborative development
3. High school language level - to support developers of all ages
4. Example-based articles - so developers can quickly create real world solutions

We all started somewhere and this is our attempt at giving developers somewhere to start.

Help us bring this dream to reality! [Fork the project](https://github.com/markwsilliman/turtlebot-tutorial), distribute it, commit changes, add articles and dream big. All content, videos & images are available for you to use as you see fit.

Simply put: Robots are awesome. None of us can bring about this revolution single-handedly.  This is the time to start hacking robots!

Change the world,

Mark Silliman
