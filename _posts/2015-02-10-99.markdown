We created this article series to give a coherent, project-based introduction and overview of ROS without having to learn all the nitty-gritty details. We left out and glossed over hundreds of powerful tools, many of which deserve their own series! Now that you’ve finished this series, more sophisticated and powerful approaches to ROS await you:

Many examples were written for TurtleBot specifically. ***Tip:** Make sure you buy the Indigo version (as opposed to Groovy or earlier which Goebel wrote as well)!*
